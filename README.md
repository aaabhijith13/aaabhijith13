## Hi👋


# 👋 Hi, I'm Abhijith Anil Vamadev

🚀 AI/ML Engineer | 🧠 Generative AI & RAG Systems | 🧰 MLOps & Cloud Infrastructure | 🧪 Researcher & Builder

### 💼 Who Am I?

I'm an applied machine learning engineer with a passion for deploying scalable AI systems and building end-to-end ML pipelines. My work spans across generative AI assistants, multi-modal LLMs, time-series forecasting, and real-time meeting intelligence using tools like **AWS SageMaker**, **Jenkins**, **Docker**, and **Recall.ai**.

Currently, I’m building:
- 🗣️ **Consigliere AI** – an AI assistant for meetings that processes live transcripts, researches unknowns, and summarizes in real-time
- ✍️ **AutoCover** – a resume & cover letter generator powered by open-source LLMs, RAG pipelines (FAISS + Neo4j), and React/FastAPI
